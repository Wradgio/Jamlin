# JaMLin
**Ja**va **M**arkup **L**anguage **In**ternalization is a simple command line tool to:

1. **Extract strings from original HTML or XML.** (eg. index.html)
	* using CSS selectors.
	* creating JSON that can be used to add translations.
2. **Replace strings with localized ones.**
	* created from JSON with translations.
	* creating new HTML or XML files (eg. index-en.html).

## What is it good for
For projects that use static HTML. Sometimes you need to keep HTML in project without additional formating, but with some internalization tool.

## How to use it
Example of using Jamlin looks like this:
`java -jar jamlin-jar-with-dependencies.jar 
	--action "extract" 
	--source "jamlin-demo.html" 
	--target "jamlin-extract.json" 
	--language "sk"`

Parameters legend:

* **action** (required) - supports 2 values:
	* "extract",
	* "replace".
* **source** - source file to read, differs according to action:
	* for "extract" action it's HTML file,
	* for "replace" action it's JSON file generated by "extract" command.
* **target** - target file to write also differs according to action:
	* for "extract" action it's JSON file,
	* for "replace" action it's HTML file generated, originaly used to extract JSON.
* **language** (optional) - language (eg. "en", "en\_US", "zh\_CN_#Hans", ...) works two ways
	* for "extract" action it sets, what language version was used for extract strings, 
	* for "replace" action sets what language you want to output.

## Why is it such a mess
It's my first tool in Java and Maven, a one man project. It will take a time to clean it up, any help is appreciated.
